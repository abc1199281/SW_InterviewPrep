# Effective C++ Notes
## Motivation
*Do things right and do the rignt thing.*

There are plenty ways to do one thing. How to do thing right? 
We should follow the C++ development so that we can utilize more effective tools.

Here I record all the questions come into my mind while learning C++11. There are several levels for me to record.

- [Basic] :
    - Classic C++/C concepts.
    - Entry level C++11 concept: 
        - Why this new function?
        - Difference

- [Middle] :
    - Eaisly confused concepts.
    - More foundamental C++11.

- [Advanced] :
    - Newer than C++11

## Structure of each answer.
### Summary
- just high level / quick answer
### Detailed information (if applicable)
- e.g., What's the method to implement this scheme?
