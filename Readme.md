# My Engineer / Research Knowledge domains notes
## Motivation
As an engineer or researcher, there are limitless things to learn.

However, time is limited, and energy of each person is also limited. 

During my Ph.D. program, I found that only systematic learning from classic text-books can help me organize knowledge, evaluate the trade-off, and find the simplest but effective solution to realistic problems.

Thus, based on the bible of discrete-time signal processing, I developed my first self-education repository ([DSP_Lab](https://github.com/abc1199281/DSP_lab)), these notes help me wrap up knowledge system and get my Ph.D. diploma.

Similarily, there are many other knowledge areas that a researcher/engineer should be familiar with. For each knowledge area, I order the topic aligned with the most clasic bible I could find.

I hope that, this self-education notes will help me effectively recap important knowledge while prepraing any further interview or dealing with related problems in work.

## Knowledge areas 
0. [Discrete Time Signal processing](https://github.com/abc1199281/DSP_lab)
    - This is my major during Ph.D. program.
1. [Data Structure](/1_DataStructure/Readme.md)
    - In this section, we want to answer **Why and When** to use specific type of data structure.
2. [C++ Containers](/2_Containers/Readme.md)
    - When it comes to implementation, there is still a question, **How?**
    - Basically, we use c++ containers as data structure to implement algorithms. 
    - So, we should really understand the foundmental implemetations of C++ containers.
3. [Algorithms](/3_Algorithm/Readme.md)
    - Part I: **Why and Whan?**, recap classical algorithm.
    - Part II: **How**, C++'s \<algorithm\>
    - Part III: **How**, Unify framework for Leet code.
3. [Effective C++](/4_EfectiveCplusplus/Readme.md)
    - A tour of C/C++
        - Memory layout, storage classes, RAII, etc.
    - C++11
        - Move semantic, forward, rvalue reference
    - Confusing questions
        - e.g., Initial value or array.
        - virtual function v.s. pure virtual function.
## Future topic
4. Computer Organization and Design    
    - Data path for different CPU stages.
    - mimic a CPU / assembler using python.
5. RTL concept
    - mimic a CPU    
6. Design pattern
7. Image signal processor
8. Image quality evaluation
9. PMP / Agile
