# My Engineer / Research Knowledge domains notes
## Motivation
As an engineer or researcher, there are limitless things to learn.

However, time is limited, and energy of each person is also limited. 

During my Ph.D. program, I found that only systematic learning from classic text-books can help me organize knowledge, evaluate the trade-off, and find the simplest but effective solution to realistic problems.

Thus, based on the bible of discrete-time signal processing, I developed my first self-education repository ([DSP_Lab](https://github.com/abc1199281/DSP_lab)), these notes help me wrap up knowledge system and get my Ph.D. diploma.

Similarily, there are many other knowledge areas that a researcher/engineer should be familiar with. For each knowledge area, I order the topic aligned with the most clasic bible I could find.

I hope that, this self-education notes will help me effectively recap important knowledge while prepraing any further interview or dealing with related problem in work.

## Knowledge domains 
1. Data Structure
    - In this section, we want to answer **Why and When** to use specific type of data structure.
2. C++ Containers
    - When it comes to implementation, there is still a question, **How?**
    - Basically, we use c++ containers as data structure to implement algorithms. 
    - So, we should really understand the foundmental implemetations of C++ containers.

## Future topic
3. Algorithms
4. C language
    - memory allocation (stack, heap, etc.) for differnt variables.
    - Note for macro usage.
5. Object oriented programming    
    - internal behavior of inherentacne.
    - virtual function v.s. pure virtual function.
6. Computer Organization and Design    
    - Data path for different CPU stages.
    - mimic a CPU / assembler using python.
7. RTL concept
    - mimic a CPU    
8. Design pattern
9. Image signal processor
10. Image quality evaluation
11. PMP / Agile
