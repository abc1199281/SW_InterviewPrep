## Knowledge domains 
1. Data Structure

2. C++ Containers
    - When it comes to implementation, there is still a question, **How?**
    - Basically, we use c++ containers as data structure to implement algorithms. 
    - So, we should really understand the foundmental implemetations of C++ containers.
3. Algorithms
    - 
4. C language
