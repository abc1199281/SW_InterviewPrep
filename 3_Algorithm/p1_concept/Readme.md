# Part I: Introduction to Algorithms

In this section, we want to recap **Why and When** to use specific type of algorithms.

For each algorithms, we would answer the questions with following structures.

## Structures
1. Abstract (high level)
    - Problem
    - Idea / Strategy
    - Results (Complexity)    
2. Problem Formulation
3. Main Idea
4. Pseudo Code
5. Pros. and Cons. (if applicable)
6. When to use?     
    - Classical applications or algorithms.
7. Alternatives
    - There are always trade-off.
8. C++ algorithm (if applicable)
9. Leet code sample (if applicable)
10. Reference (if applicable)

## Outline
1. Foundations
2. Sorting and order statics
3. Data Structures (Skipped)
4. Advanced Design and Analysis Techniques
5. Advanced Data Structures
6. Graph Algorithms
7. Selected Topics
